## Guardrails

Rules to prevent burnout and maintain sustainability:

1. **1 true rest day/week** — [e.g., "Sunday: no work, no guilt"]
2. **Weekly review (15-30 min)** — [e.g., "Sunday evening: check progress and adjust"]
3. **Core vs Flex distinction** — [e.g., "10 hrs/week core, 5 hrs/week flex"]
4. **Permission to adjust** — [e.g., "If energy tanks, scale back to core hours only"]
5. **Side quest filter** — [e.g., "Does this move me closer to my goal? If no, defer it."]
6. **Backup plan** — [What you'll do if Plan A doesn't work]
