TEMPLATE: Cascade Weekly Plan

Generated by the `plan` command. This file follows the Cascade methodology:

GRAVITY: Targets are based on last week's actuals, not the original plan.
If you completed 60% last week, this week adjusts accordingly.

CORE/FLEX: Core tasks are the plan. If you only complete Core, you're on track.
Flex tasks are acceleration — reach for them when energy allows.
If this plan needs Flex to hit monthly targets, scope is too high.

ADAPTATIONS: If data/adaptations.md has active patterns (e.g., "skip Fridays",
"lighter Wednesdays"), they're already applied to this plan.

To customize: edit this file directly, or run `plan` to regenerate.
